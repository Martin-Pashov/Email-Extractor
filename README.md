# Email-Extractor
This is a straightforward exercise on the subject of RegEx. The code can be found in the "Program.cs" file, located iside of the "Email_Extractor" folder. 

The main idea behind this project is for the user to type some text into the console, which would only return emails (from the text writen). As of right now, roughly 75% of the examples I have given the program have succeeded, indicating that it does not perform quite well. 

I think that the error is somewhere in the RegEx, however I have no idea how to fix it.
