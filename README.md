# Email-Extractor
This is a straightforward exercise on the subject of RegEx. The code can be found in the "Program.cs" file, located iside of the "Email_Extractor" folder. 

The main idea of this project is for the user to paste some text in the console, wich will return only the emails (from the text writen). As of right now ~75% of the examples that I have given the program have worked, which means that it doesnt work well.
